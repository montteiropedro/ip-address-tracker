## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
- Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

## How to use

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository (via HTTPS or SSH)
$ git clone https://github.com/montteiropedro/ip-address-tracker.git
$ git clone git@github.com:montteiropedro/ip-address-tracker.git
```

Now, navigate inside the project folder. There you will find a file named `.env.example`, from it you can easily configure your environment variables. Don't forget to rename this file to `.env`, only then it will be functional.

After this we must install the project dependencies. We can do this by running the following command:  

```bash
# Install dependencies (You must do this step inside the project folder)
$ npm install
```

With the dependencies installed we can run:

```bash
# Run app in localhost
npm run dev

# Compile and Build the app
npm run build
```
